1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
 --> A new hidden file called .git is created and our directory becomes a git repository
 
2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
 --> It is the temporary area where we add the files to be committed

3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
 --> By adding only 1 file to the staging area before committing it
